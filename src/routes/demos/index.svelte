        An <strong>"Instance"</strong> is a single Video Queue implementation accessible between a requestor and an agent.
        This means users can now request support from a device to be connected to an agent in desired orderly manner. No
        authentication has been implemented for simplicity.
      </p>
      <p class="has-text-weight-semibold">
        We highly recommend you create an individual "Instance" per customer or use case in order to avoid confusion!
